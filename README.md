# Cybersecurity Labs & Python Scripts 🛡️🐍

Welcome to my learning repository! This space serves as a technical journal of my professional transition into **Cybersecurity**. Here, I document my progress, hands-on labs, and automation scripts.

## 🚀 About This Repository
This project stems from my commitment to continuous learning. The content is primarily divided into two streams:
1.  **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate:** Practical application of course modules including Linux, Python, SQL, Networking, and Incident Response.
2.  **Independent Research:** Personal projects and labs developed to deepen my understanding of security tools and programming logic.

## 🛠️ What You Will Find Here

### 🐍 Python for Security & Automation
Scripts designed to improve efficiency and understand the logic behind digital attacks and defenses.


### 🐧 Linux & IAM Labs
Technical documentation on system administration using the **CLI** (Command Line Interface):
* **Identity & Access Management (IAM):** Configuring users, groups, and permissions based on the *Principle of Least Privilege*.
* **System Hardening:** Implementing security configurations within virtual environments.

## 📈 My Goal
My objective is to bridge the gap between my extensive background in operations management and risk analysis with a robust technical foundation. I firmly believe that security is not just a set of tools, but a problem-solving mindset.
